# QuietVR
> A quiet place in VR.

## What is QuietVR
A place in VR where only you should be the one to make noises. And when you do, your noises summon objects that will decorate your surrounding.

## Inspiration and Motivation
This project is inspired by Armin van Buuren's YouTube video of [Intense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UoNXz0Ox-g).
The initial thought was to create a simple VR experience where the player is surrounded by blocks and low polygon geometries. After a few iterations of implementation, it eventually turns into VR demo that focuses on audio reactive interaction.

The whole purpose of this project from a development perspective is to seek harmonic correlation between VR and audio input and how to create fun VR gameplay with simple vocal elements.

## Installation
Please go to the release page to download the latest version.
https://github.com/diglungdig/QuietVR/releases
Each release contains a VR version that works with HTC Vive/Oculus Rift and a non-VR version that works with normal PC setups.

Please note that it's recommended to play in VR just like beer has to be put into fridge to be good.

## How to Play
**QuietVR requires a quiet environment to start with.** If you are not in a peaceful place, gameplay will most likely be disrupted for its solely relying on audio input.
